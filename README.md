天安门广场抗议

天安门广场抗议活动，中文称为“六四事件”，是 1989 年在北京天安门广场举行的由学生领导的示威活动。在所谓的天安门广场大屠杀中，手持突击步枪和坦克的部队向示威者和那些试图阻止军队进入天安门广场的人。抗议活动于 4 月 15 日开始，并在 6 月 4 日政府宣布戒严并派人民解放军占领北京市中心部分地区时被强行镇压。

估计死亡人数从几百到几千不等，还有数千人受伤。受北京抗议活动启发的民族运动有时被称为“89 民主运动”或“天安门事件”。

1989 年 4 月，在后毛泽东时代经济快速发展和社会变革的背景下，支持改革的中共总书记胡耀邦去世，引发了抗议活动，反映了人民和政治精英们对中共政权的焦虑。国家的未来。

1980年代的改革催生了新兴市场经济，使一些人受益，但对另一些人严重不利，一党制政治体制的合法性也面临挑战。当时普遍的不满包括通货膨胀、腐败、毕业生对新经济的准备不足以及政治参与的限制。

尽管他们高度杂乱无章，目标也各不相同，但学生们呼吁加强问责制、宪法正当程序、民主、新闻自由和言论自由。在抗议活动最激烈的时候，大约有一百万人聚集在广场上。

随着抗议活动的发展，当局采取了和解和强硬的策略，暴露了党内领导层的深刻分歧。到 5 月，由学生领导的绝食抗议在全国范围内激发了对示威者的支持，抗议活动蔓延到大约 400 个城市。在中共最高领导层中，李鹏总理和党的长老李先念、王震呼吁采取果断行动，对抗议者进行暴力镇压，最终将最高领导人邓小平和杨尚昆主席拉到了他们一边。

5月20日，国务院宣布戒严。他们调集了多达 300,000 名士兵到北京。 6 月 4 日凌晨，军队在城市的主要干道上向北京市中心进军，在此过程中杀死了示威者和旁观者。军事行动由杨尚昆总统的同父异母兄弟杨白兵将军全面指挥。国际社会、人权组织和政治分析家谴责中国政府的大屠杀。西方国家对中国实施武器禁运。

中国政府广泛逮捕抗议者及其支持者，镇压中国各地的其他抗议活动，驱逐外国记者，严格控制国内媒体对事件的报道，加强警察和国内安全部队，并降级或清洗它认为同情的官员抗议。

更广泛地说，镇压结束了 1986 年开始的政治改革，并停止了 1980 年代的自由化政策，这些政策在 1992 年邓小平南巡后才部分恢复。被认为是一个分水岭事件，对抗议活动的反应限制了政治表达中国一直延续到现在。记住抗议活动与质疑中共的合法性广泛相关，并且仍然是中国最敏感和最广泛审查的话题之一。

The Tiananmen Square protests, known in Chinese as the June Fourth Incident, were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square, Beijing during 1989. In what is known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops armed with assault rifles and accompanied by tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square. The protests started on 15 April and were forcibly suppressed on 4 June when the government declared martial law and sent the People's Liberation Army to occupy parts of central Beijing. 

Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded. The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement or the Tiananmen Square Incident.

The protests were precipitated by the death of pro-reform Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Hu Yaobang in April 1989 amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social change in post-Mao China, reflecting anxieties among the people and political elite about the country's future. 

The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy that benefited some people but seriously disadvantaged others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge to its legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy, and restrictions on political participation. 

Although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied, the students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. At the height of the protests, about one million people assembled in the Square.

As the protests developed, the authorities responded with both conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership. By May, a student-led hunger strike galvanized support around the country for the demonstrators, and the protests spread to some 400 cities. Among the CCP's top leadership, Premier Li Peng and Party Elders Li Xiannian and Wang Zhen called for decisive action through violent suppression of the protesters, and ultimately managed to win over Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping and President Yang Shangkun to their side. 

On 20 May, the State Council declared martial law. They mobilized as many as ~300,000 troops to Beijing. The troops advanced into central parts of Beijing on the city's major thoroughfares in the early morning hours of 4 June, killing both demonstrators and bystanders in the process. The military operations were under the overall command of General Yang Baibing, half-brother of President Yang Shangkun. The international community, human rights organizations, and political analysts condemned the Chinese government for the massacre. Western countries imposed arms embargoes on China.

The Chinese government made widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters, suppressed other protests around China, expelled foreign journalists, strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press, strengthened the police and internal security forces, and demoted or purged officials it deemed sympathetic to the protests.

More broadly, the suppression ended the political reforms begun in 1986 and halted the policies of liberalization of the 1980s, which were only partly resumed after Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour in 1992. Considered a watershed event, reaction to the protests set limits on political expression in China that have lasted up to the present day. Remembering the protests is widely associated with questioning the legitimacy of the CCP and remains one of the most sensitive and most widely censored topics in China.
